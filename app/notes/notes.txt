so i will write some notes here 

why we put response_model in our decorator parameter
    suppose we want to output only title and content and if we dont use response_model then
    id will output everything whaterver user provide.so we define a class in schemas.py 
    so that we can validate our output acoording to our need in sort term we can response 
    whaterver the fuck we want.and we also put config class under our response class becoz 
    the output that get return was in orm model and response model only knows dict so he 
    doesnt underustand anything so we put orm_mode=True so that our output get converted into 
    dict type and then get printed.


explain this line--
get2this=db.query(models.Post,func.count(models.Vote.post_id).label('votes')).join(models.Vote,models.Post.id==models.Vote.post_id,isouter=True).group_by(models.Post.id).filter(models.Post.title.contains(search)).limit(limit).offset(skip).all()
